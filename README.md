# bump-package-dep

Automatically sets and commits appropriate versions of package dependencies for Atom based on current package.json values.

## Installation

Prerequisite: `jq` [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) â€” Install it with Homebrew with `brew install jq`

If you have `~/bin` or similar on your path, you can do

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BinaryMuse/bump-package-dep/master/bump-package-dep.sh -o ~/bin/bump-package-dep
chmod +x bump-package-dep
```

If you want to install it to `/usr/local/bin`, you can run:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BinaryMuse/bump-package-dep/master/bump-package-dep.sh -o /usr/local/bin/bump-package-dep
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bump-package-dep
```

(This assumes that you have write access to `/usr/local/bin`)

## Example

Here, Atom is bundling tree-view v0.215.3, but we have v0.216.0 as the current version in tree-view's `package.json`:

```bash
$ jq '.packageDependencies."tree-view"' package.json
"0.215.3"
$ jq .version ~/github/tree-view/package.json
"0.216.0"
```

Let's update it!

```bash
$ bump-package-dep ~/github/tree-view
